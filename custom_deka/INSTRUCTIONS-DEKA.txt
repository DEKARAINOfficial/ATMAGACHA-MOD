How to use this skin pack for Custom Ball Merge:

1. Once you download it from my official GitHub, put the folder within the game folder itself where the game launcher is (Alongside the "custom" folder, and where the "custom_skin_template" is. DO NOT PUT THIS WITHIN ANY FOLDERS.).

2. Open the main game, then go to "Settings" (Gear icon).

3. Click on "Custom Textures". Then, locate my skin pack for the game ("custom_deka").

4. Enjoy the personalized cute gacha balls in your house! (Just kidding... Enjoy my art style!)
