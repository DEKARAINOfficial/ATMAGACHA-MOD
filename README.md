# ATMAGACHA-MOD
A simple skin mod for the game "Custom Ball Merge" - a GoDot game developed by David Wu SoftDev.

This skin mod makes use of a gachapon style replacing "Emojicon Balls" (which replace the fruits in the Suika Game/Watermelon Game). Each ball represents a character in my original work.
I'm just gonna say which ball represents which:

custom1 - Soul (Self-explanatory, that's a baby fireball.)
custom2 - Spark (It grows bigger. Evolves from Soul.)
custom3 - Basil (A plant fae character. You can find them in my PaperDemon profile for their lore! Evolves from Spark.)
custom4 - Mazuri (A pink-haired character yet to be redesigned. Represented by a heart.)
custom5 - Kuro Shori (A female character who controls ice, yet to be redesigned.)
custom6 - Asura (A lavender-haired character who controls psychic energy. Yet to be redesigned.)
custom7 - Astra (A yellow-haired character who controls light. Yet to be redesigned.)
custom8 - Flora (A female Faun character whose strength can break mountains themselves. Yet to be redesigned.)
custom9 - Lara (A black-haired girl who controls the abstract forces stemming from her passion of art.)
custom10 - The Final Drifter (Lara, but she's literally on fire, because this is her second phase.)
custom11 - The Dayosa (A mysterious "thing" that is responsible for the cosmic balance. Merging two of them and achieving them is hard effort.)

Can you get them all in one run? Good luck, and enjoy my art style!
